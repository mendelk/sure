## Fork baseline

This fork is based on upstream [Sure v0.7.5](https://github.com/we-promise/sure/releases/tag/v0.7.5)
(`5fc037defefa8e4d79c0e4b9da2937dd8048ac79`) and identifies itself as `0.7.5-fork.1`.
It retains the fork's transaction autocomplete and exclusion filters, configurable
transaction columns, merchant shortcuts and APIs, transfer-aware splits, SureQL
editor, deployment/workspace tooling, and planning vault.

Desktop and mobile transaction tag pickers stay synchronized without a page reload;
transfer tag edits update both legs. CI covers persisted tag changes and keyboard focus.
The report currency regression also runs safely when month-start rates already exist
in the exchange-rate fixtures.

## Backstory

The [Maybe Finance](https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe) (archived/abandoned repo) team spent most of 2021–2022 building a full-featured personal finance and wealth management app. It even included an “Ask an Advisor” feature that connected users with a real CFP/CFA — all included with your subscription.

The business end of things didn't work out, and so they stopped developing the app in mid-2023.

After spending nearly $1 million on development (employees, contractors, data providers, infra, etc.), the team open-sourced the app. Their goal was to let users self-host it for free — and eventually launch a hosted version for a small fee.

They actually did launch that hosted version … briefly.

That also didn’t work out — at least not as a sustainable B2C business — so now here we are: hosting a community-maintained fork to keep the codebase alive and see where this can go next.

Join us!

## Hosting Sure

Sure is a fully working personal finance app that can be [self hosted with Docker](docs/hosting/docker.md).
Sure can be accessed from a browser, the macOS desktop app, the mobile app, API
clients, and LLM agents. See [Sure Clients](docs/clients.md) for an overview.

### CI-gated Dokploy deployment

Pushes to `main` deploy this fork through the `deploy` job in
[`.github/workflows/main.yml`](.github/workflows/main.yml), only after the reusable
CI workflow succeeds. Chart-only changes and manual CI runs do not deploy.

The GitHub `production` environment contains:

- Variable `DOKPLOY_URL`: the HTTPS base URL of the Dokploy instance.
- Variable `DOKPLOY_COMPOSE_ID`: the Sure Docker Compose service ID.
- Secret `DOKPLOY_API_KEY`: an API key authorized to deploy that service.

Restrict that environment to the `main` branch. Disable Dokploy's **Auto Deploy**
setting and the repository's direct Dokploy push webhook; otherwise pushes can
bypass the CI gate. Deployment requests are serialized, and runs for commits that
are no longer the head of `main` are skipped.

The job requests a build of Dokploy's configured `main` branch, not an immutable
image or pinned Git revision. A successful job means Dokploy accepted the request;
check its deployment logs for the build result and application health.

## Forking and Attribution

This repo is a community fork of the archived Maybe Finance repo.
You’re free to fork it under the AGPLv3 license — but we’d love it if you stuck around and contributed here instead.

To stay compliant and avoid trademark issues:

- Be sure to include the original [AGPLv3 license](https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/blob/main/LICENSE) and clearly state in your README that your fork is based on Maybe Finance but is **not affiliated with or endorsed by** Maybe Finance Inc.
- "Maybe" is a trademark of Maybe Finance Inc. and therefore, use of it is NOT allowed in forked repositories (or the logo)

## Performance Issues

With data-heavy apps, inevitably, there are performance issues. We've set up a public dashboard showing the problematic requests seen on the demo site, along with the stacktraces to help debug them.

[https://www.skylight.io/app/applications/s6PEZSKwcklL/recent/6h/endpoints](https://oss.skylight.io/app/applications/s6PEZSKwcklL/recent/6h/endpoints)

Any contributions that help improve performance are very much welcome.

## Local Development Setup

**If you are trying to _self-host_ the app, [read this guide to get started](docs/hosting/docker.md).**

The instructions below are for developers to get started with contributing to the app.

### Requirements

- See `.ruby-version` file for required Ruby version
- PostgreSQL >9.3 (latest stable version recommended)
- Redis > 5.4 (latest stable version recommended)

### Getting Started
```sh
cd sure
cp .env.local.example .env.local
bin/setup
bin/dev

# Optionally, load demo data
rake demo_data:default
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

If you loaded the optional demo data, log in with these credentials:

- Email: `user@example.com`
- Password: `Password1!`

### One-click Install

Render expects each button target branch to have a `render.yaml` at the repository root. The branch-ready Blueprint files live in `branches/<branch-name>/render.yaml` in a separate repo and can be copied to each corresponding branch root.
